=============
+ This Library Provides Wrapper Functions for the Pololu LSM303 Accelerometer Class
    + It is designed to work on the [ZUMO32U4 robot](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/all) using the [Arduino Integrated Development Enviornment](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
+ The functions are outlined in the header file  
    + They consist of functions to get acceleration in x, y, and z axes in centimeters per second squared
+ An example file is provided
    + It prints the robots Accelerations
