Zumo Automation Project
=======================
* The goal of this project is to
    1. Allow two ZUMO32U4 robots to play a match  
    2. Have the robots know who won  
    3. Enable the robots to wirelessly communicate match data to a master laptop  
    4. Allow the robots to charge themselves wirelessly  
    5. Allow the robots to reset for a new match automatically  
    6. Create a machine learning exercise whereby the robots can learn the best strategy by playing eachother  

* This project was conceived of by technical advisor Tim Hebert and is currently being implemented by Matthew Millendorf and Jacob Smith
* We are always looking for anyone who wants to contribute, email us!
