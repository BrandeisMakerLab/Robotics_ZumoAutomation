Zumo Automation Project
=======================
* The goal of this project is to
    1. Allow two ZUMO32U4 robots to play a mini sumo match https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL8IRF4wQmU
    2. Have the robots know who won  
    3. Enable the robots to wirelessly communicate match data to a master laptop  
    4. Allow the robots to charge themselves wirelessly  
    5. Allow the robots to reset for a new match automatically  
    6. Create a machine learning exercise whereby the robots can learn the best strategy by playing eachother
