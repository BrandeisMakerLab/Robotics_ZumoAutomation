Drive Library
=============
+ This Library Provides Wrapper Functions for the ZUMO32U4 Motors Class  
    + It is designed to work on the [ZUMO32U4 robot](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/all) using the [Arduino Integrated Development Enviornment](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
+ The functions are outlined in the header file  
    + They consist of driving, turning, and stopping functions 
    + which can be used either as a step in a sequence or integrated into more advanced programs
+ An example file is provided
    + It uses the simplified robot commands to drive, turn, and stop for half a second
