/*! \brief Plays beeps and music on the buzzer on the Zumo 32U4.
 *
 * This class uses Timer 4 and pin 6 (PD7/OC4D) to play beeps and melodies on
 * the Zumo 32U4 buzzer.
 *
 * Note durations are timed using a timer overflow interrupt
 * (`TIMER4_OVF`), which will briefly interrupt execution of your
 * main program at the frequency of the sound being played. In most cases, the
 * interrupt-handling routine is very short (several microseconds). However,
 * when playing a sequence of notes in `PLAY_AUTOMATIC` mode (the default mode)
 * with the `play()` command, this interrupt takes much longer than normal
 * (perhaps several hundred microseconds) every time it starts a new note. It is
 * important to take this into account when writing timing-critical code.
