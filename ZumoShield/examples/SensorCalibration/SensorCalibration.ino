/*
This example is designed to be run an Arduino that is connected to a Zumo
Reflectance Sensor Array through a Zumo Shield.

The setup phase of this example calibrates the sensor for ten seconds and
turns on the pin 13 LED while calibration is going on.  During this phase,
you should expose each reflectance sensor to the lightest and darkest
readings they will encounter.  For example, if you are making a line
follower, you should slide the sensors across the line during the
calibration phase so that each sensor can get a reading of how dark the
line is and how light the ground is.  Improper calibration will result in
poor readings. If you want to skip the calibration phase, you can get the
raw sensor readings (pulse times from 0 to 2500 us) by calling
reflectance.read(sensorValues) instead of
reflectance.readLine(sensorValues).

The loop function reads the calibrated sensor values.  It also uses the
values to estimate the position of a line, in case you are using the Zumo
for line following. It prints the sensor values to the serial monitor as
numbers from 0 (maximum reflectance) to 1000 (minimum reflectance) followed
by the estimated location of the line as a number from 0 to 5000.  A line
position of 1000 means the line is directly under sensor 1, 2000 means
directly under sensor 2, etc.  0 means the line is directly under sensor 0
or was last seen by sensor 0 before being lost.  5000 means the line is
directly under sensor 5 or was last seen by sensor 5 before being lost.
