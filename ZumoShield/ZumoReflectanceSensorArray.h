 * \brief Read from reflectance sensor array
 *
 * ZumoReflectanceSensorArray provides an interface for using a
 * [Zumo Reflectance Sensor Array](https://www.pololu.com/product/1419) connected
 * to a Zumo robot. It provides access to the raw sensor values as well
 * as to high level functions including calibration and line-tracking.
 *
 * For calibration, memory is allocated using the `malloc()` function. This
 * conserves RAM: if all six sensors are calibrated with the emitters both on
 * and off, a total of 48 bytes is dedicated to storing calibration values.
 * However, for an application where only two sensors are used, and the
 * emitters are always on during reads, only 4 bytes are required.
 *
 * Internally, it uses all standard Arduino functions such as
 * `micros()` for timing and `digitalRead()` for getting the sensor values, so
 * it should work on all Arduinos without conflicting with other libraries.
 *
 * ### Calibration ###
 *
 * ZumoReflectanceSensorArray allows you to use the `calibrate()`
 * method to easily calibrate your sensors for the particular
 * conditions it will encounter. Calibrating your sensors can lead to
 * substantially more reliable sensor readings, which in turn can help
 * simplify your code. As such, we recommend you build a calibration
 * phase into your Zumo's initialization routine. This can be as
 * simple as a fixed duration over which you repeatedly call the
 * `calibrate()` method.
 *
 * During this calibration phase, you will need to expose each of your
 * reflectance sensors to the lightest and darkest readings they will
 * encounter.  For example, if your Zumo is programmed to be a line
 * follower, you will want to slide it across the line during the
 * calibration phase so the each sensor can get a reading of how dark
 * the line is and how light the ground is (or you can program it to
 * automatically turn back and forth to pass all of the sensors over
 * the line). The **SensorCalibration** example demonstrates a
 * calibration routine.
 *
 * ### Reading the sensors
 *
 *
 * ZumoReflectanceSensorArray gives you a number of different ways to
 * read the sensors.
 *
 * - You can request raw sensor values using the `read()` method.
 *
 * - You can request calibrated sensor values using the `readCalibrated()`
 *   method. Calibrated sensor values will always range from 0 to 1000, with the
 *   extreme values corresponding to the most and least reflective surfaces
 *   encountered during calibration.
 *
 * - For line-detection applications, you can request the line location using
 *   the `readLine()` method. This function provides calibrated values
 *   for each sensor and returns an integer that tells you where it thinks the
 *   line is.
 *
 * ### Class inheritance ###
 *
 * The ZumoReflectanceSensorArray class is derived from the QTRSensorsRC class,
 * which is in turn derived from the QTRSensors base class. The QTRSensorsRC and
 * QTRSensors classes are part of the \ref QTRSensors.h "QTRSensors" library,
 * which provides more general functionality for working with reflectance
 * sensors and is included in the Zumo Shield Arduino Library as a dependency
 * for this library.
 *
 * We recommend using ZumoReflectanceSensorArray instead of
 * the \ref QTRSensors.h "QTRSensors" library when programming an Arduino on a
 * Zumo. For documentation specific to the %QTRSensors library, please see its
 * [user's guide](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J19) on Pololu's website.

   * \a timeout specifies the length of time in microseconds beyond which you

   * length for a pin exceeds \a timeout, pulse timing will stop and the reading
   * for that pin will be considered full black. It is recommended that you set
   * \a timeout to be between 1000 and 3000 us, depending on factors like the
   * height of your sensors and ambient lighting. This allows you to shorten the
   * duration of a sensor-reading cycle while maintaining useful measurements of
   * reflectance. If \a timeout is not specified, it defaults to 2000 us. (See
   * the [product page](https://www.pololu.com/product/1419) for the Zumo
   * Reflectance Sensor Array on Pololu's website for an overview of the
   * sensors' principle of operation.)
   *
   * \a emitterPin is the Arduino digital pin that controls whether the IR LEDs
   * are on or off. This pin is optional; if a valid pin is specified, the
   * emitters will only be turned on during a reading. If \a emitterPin is not

   * jumper on the Zumo Reflectance Sensor Array.) If the value
   * `QTR_NO_EMITTER_PIN` (255) is used, you can leave the emitter pin
   * disconnected and the IR emitters will always be on.
   *
   * This version of `%init()` can be useful if you only want to use a subset
   * of the six reflectance sensors on the array. For example, using the
   * outermost two sensors (on pins 4 and 5 by default) is usually enough for
   * detecting the ring border in sumo competitions:

   * ZumoReflectanceSensorArray reflectanceSensors;
   *
   * ...

   * "a different constructor" to declare and initialize the object at the same
   * time:

 * provided in the constructor (which defaults to 2000).
 *
 * The \a readMode argument specifies the kind of read that will be performed.
 * Several options are defined:
 *
 * - `QTR_EMITTERS_OFF` specifies that the reading should be made without
 *   turning on the infrared (IR) emitters, in which case the reading represents
 *   ambient light levels near the sensor.
 * - `QTR_EMITTERS_ON` specifies that the emitters should be turned on for the
 *   reading, which results in a measure of reflectance.
 * - `QTR_EMITTERS_ON_AND_OFF` specifies that a reading should be made in both
 *   the on and off states. The values returned when this option is used are
 *   given by the formula **on + max &minus; off**, where **on** is the reading
 *   with the emitters on, **off** is the reading with the emitters off, and
 *   **max** is the maximum sensor reading. This option can reduce the amount of
 *   interference from uneven ambient lighting.

 * \return An estimated line position.
 *
 * This function operates the same as `readCalibrated()`, but with a feature
 * designed for line following: it returns an estimated position of the line.
 * The estimate is made using a weighted average of the sensor indices
 * multiplied by 1000, so that a return value of 0 indicates that the line is
 * directly below sensor 0 (or was last seen by sensor 0 before being lost), a
 * return value of 1000 indicates that the line is directly below sensor 1, 2000
 * indicates that it's below sensor 2, etc. Intermediate values indicate that
 * the line is between two sensors. The formula is:
 *
 * \f[
 *   \newcommand{sv}[1]{\mathtt{sensor_values[#1]}}
 *   \text{return value} =
 *     \frac{(0 \times \sv{0}) + (1000 \times \sv{1}) + (2000 \times \sv{2}) + \ldots}
 *          {\sv{0} + \sv{1} + \sv{2} + \ldots}
 * \f]
 *
 * As long as your sensors aren't spaced too far apart relative to the line,
 * this returned value is designed to be monotonic, which makes it great for use
 * in closed-loop PID control. Additionally, this method remembers where it last
 * saw the line, so if you ever lose the line to the left or the right, its line
 * position will continue to indicate the direction you need to go to reacquire
 * the line. For example, if sensor 5 is your rightmost sensor and you end up
 * completely off the line to the left, this function will continue to return
 * 5000.
 *
 * By default, this function assumes a dark line (high values) on a light
 * background (low values). If your line is light on dark, set the optional
 * second argument \a whiteLine to true. In this case, each sensor value will be
 * replaced by the maximum possible value minus its actual value before the
 * averaging.
 *
 * The ZumoReflectanceSensorArray class inherits this function from the
