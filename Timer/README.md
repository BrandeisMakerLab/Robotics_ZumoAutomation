Timer Library
=============
+ This library is a wrapper class for the [Arduino time function](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/time/millis/)
+ This library allows for the instantiation of a timer object which can return the current time, be reset, and be used on an interval
+ This allows an arduino board to continually perform an update procedure without the use of delay statements
+ The provided example file shows the suggested use of this class on a [ZUMO32U4 robot](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/all) using the [Arduino Integrated Development Enviornment](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
