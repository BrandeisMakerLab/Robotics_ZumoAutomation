ENCODER LIBRARY
===============
+ This library provides wrapper functions for the Pololu ZUMO32U4 Encoders class
	+ It is designed to work on the [ZUMO32U4 robot](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/all) using the [Arduino Integrated Development Enviornment](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
+ The functions are outlined in the .h header file
	+ they allow the robot's left side position, right side position, left side velocity, right side velocity, and overall direction to be returned
	+ in addition, methods are provided to return the robot's average position and velocity between its left and right sides
+ An example file is provided
	+ it prints the robots position, velocity, and direction
